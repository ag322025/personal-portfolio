export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hi, I'm Aravind G, a Software Developer based in Mysore. I enjoy building web applications that are responsive, easy to use, and built to scale. I mainly work with React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, and I focus on creating clean, user-friendly interfaces that help improve how people interact with software.
I'm currently working at CEPT, Department of Posts (DoP), where I'm part of the team behind the India Post Delivery and Postman Management System. This project is now used in over 150,000 post offices across India. I’ve worked on several key modules like Shift Management, Beat Mapping, and eMO Handling, and I’ve helped improve the app’s performance using CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitLab.
Before this, I worked on a Distribution Management System (DMS) for the healthcare industry. It was built to help hospitals and distributors manage surgery implant inventory in real-time, reducing manual work and improving coordination.
I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from East Point College of Engineering and Technology, and over the years, I’ve gained experience working in Agile teams, collaborating on feature development, and writing maintainable, reusable code.
When I’m not coding, I enjoy learning about new tech, trying out tools, and improving my skills one project at a time`;
